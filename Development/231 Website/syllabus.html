  <h1>Introduction to Programming I<br>Summer Semester, 2018 <br></h1>
  <h2> Description </h2>
  <p>Introduction to programming using Python.  Design, implementation and testing of programs to solve problems primarily in engineering, mathematics and science. Programming fundamentals, functions, classes, lists, and dictionaries.</p>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>In this course, students will study general programming concepts, as well as a modern programming language which illustrates those concepts. Students will design, implement and test Python programs.</p>
  <p>At the end of this course when presented with a problem we expect that a student with respond: "Hey, I can write a program to do that!"</p>
  <h2>Highlights </h2>
  <p>You are responsible for all the details in the syllabus below, but here are highlights.
  <ul>
    <li>Grade Points: 1000 points from weekly programming projects, exercises, and three exams.</li>
    <li>Labs including pre-labs are required: your final grade will be reduced if you miss more than two.</li>
    <li>If you collaborate on programming projects, you will get a zero.</li>
    <li>We frequently send email from msu.edu and cse.msu.edu .  It is important that you ensure that your email client isn't routing our emails to Junk -- otherwise you will miss critical email about the course.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructors</h2>

  <p> Office Hours: To schedule an appointment go to my <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=enbody@gmail.com&ctz=America/New_York">Google calendar</a>, find an available
  slot, send an email requesting an appointment at that time -- the email is to handle
  overlapping requests. (With 700 students I find that any regularly scheduled times
  do not work for too many students so individual appointments are more convenient for
  students.)</p>

  <h2> Course Web Site </h2>
  <p>
    Couse Web Site: <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/">https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231 </a>
  <p>
    Discussion boards will be on <a href="https://piazza.com/"> https://piazza.com </a>
  </p>
  <h2>Required Course Material</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <img alt="book cover image" src="Text_3rd.jpg" align="top" border=0 width=50 height=60>
    <b>The Practice of Computing using Python, 3rd Ed.</b> 
    by Punch and Enbody. ISBN-13: 9780134379760 (or 9780134380315 )
  </li>
  <li>
  For submission and auto-testing of projects we use Mimir, a commercial product. You will find a link on the D2L
  course page. (There is normally a $25 charge,
  but don't pay it because the Engineering Dean has agreed to pay it -- details are being worked out at the start
  of the semester.)
  </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Due Dates </h2>
  <p>
     The Due Dates Page is your guide to due dates for the semester:
  <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/due_dates.html">https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/due_dates.html</a> 
  <br><br>
     To allow some flexibility:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Programming Projects</b>: late submissions are reduced 50% for up to one day late; no credit after one day.
  </li>
    <li><b>Labs </b>: 
    Contact your TA about any extenuating circumstances <b>before</b> lab.  Old labs cannot be made up.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Except for extreme circumstances (e.g. a car crash puts you overnight in a hospital) there will be no other extensions.
  </p>
  <p>
  Due times are U.S. Eastern Standard Time.  Mimir uses your computer's time setting to display time in your browser so if your computer's
  time is set to a different time zone, you will be misled by displayed due dates and times.
  </p>
  <h2> Course Grades </h2>
  <p>
    Each student's course grade will be based on the sum of the points earned in
    the following categories (points are different for the Honors Section):
  <br><br>
  <table cellpadding=5>
    <tr>
      <td> Examinations </td>
      <td> (45% of total course points)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Computer Projects</td>
      <td>(45% of total course points) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chapter Exercises </td>
      <td>(10% of total course points)</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
      
  <br>
    To be eligible to earn a non-zero grade in the course, a student normally must 
    earn at least 50% of the total points for the examinations and
    earn at least 50% of the total points for the computer projects.
  </p>
  <p>     
    The following table gives the scale for course grades:
  <br><br>
  <table cellpadding=5>
    <tr>
      <td> 4.0 </td>
      <td> 90% of points available </td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td> 3.5 </td>
      <td> 85% of points available </td>
    </tr>  <tr>
      <td> 3.0 </td>
      <td> 80% of points available </td>
    </tr>  <tr>
      <td> 2.5 </td>
      <td> 75% of points available </td>
    </tr>  <tr>
      <td> 2.0 </td>
      <td> 70% of points available </td>
    </tr>  <tr>
      <td> 1.5 </td>
      <td> 65% of points available </td>
    </tr>  <tr>
      <td> 1.0 </td>
      <td> 60% of points available </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br>    
    The instructor reserves the right to adjust the scale for course grades, if
    necessary.
  <br><br>  
   <b>Important:</b> Students who get a zero ("no credit") on more than two (2) laboratory exercises 
    will have their course grade <i> reduced </i> by <i> 0.5 for each laboratory exercise 
    missed</i> beyond two. For example, if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but 
    zeros four (4) laboratory exercises, that student's grade will be 
    reduced by 2*0.5 to a 2.0 course grade. 
  </p>
  <h2> Exams </h2>
  <p>
    A midterm examination and a final examination will be conducted during
    the semester, and will constitute 45% of the total course points. 
    You will be allowed one sheet of notes (8.5x11 inches) both sides, 
    but no electronic devices.  Non-native English speakers may bring a paper dictionary.
  <br><br>
    Students in the online section have the option of taking exams on campus (no fee) or
    taking exams remotely for a fee (we use a commercial online proctoring firm which charges approximately $15 per
  exam, and requires a web cam).
    Online students planning on taking exams remotely will have to make proctoring
    arrangements with the instructor 10 days before the exam.  Remote exams take place at the same time
    on the same day as local exams using Eastern Time US.
  <ul>
    <li> Midterm Exam Exam (20%) Thursday, June 7, 10:00 AM, ANH 1281
    <li> Final Exam (25%) Thursday, June 28, 10:00 AM, ANH 1281
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  All issues related to the final examination will follow the policies and
  schedule of the University:<a href="https://www.reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Calendar/FinalExam.aspx"> MSU Final Exam Schedule</a>.
  </p>
  <h2> Labs </h2>
  <p>
    Labs are mandatory and there will be a laboratory exercise due every week.
    Missing labs will reduce your final grade (see below).
  <br><br>
    The labs are designed to be learning tools that complement
    the lectures and assigned readings.  They are designed to be collaborative
    experiences where students work with each other and the Teaching Assistant
    to complete the lab exercises.
    <ul>
    <li>Labs are credit/no-credit.  To receive credit for a lab
    <ol>
            <li> You must complete the Pre-Lab, before your lab or the pre-lab deadline, whichever comes first.  Pre-labs are "warm-up" for the labs and are not expected to be perfect -- our expectation is necessarily fuzzy for pre-labs: "you are expected to get most of them correct most of the time."
  </li>
            <li> When Mimir tests exist, they test perfection.  The Mimir tests allow you to verify that your
  code is correct.  However, you can get credit for correct Lab code that isn't perfect, i.e. it is possible to
  get credit for code that fails Mimir tests. (Note that Projects are more strict with respect to Mimir tests.)
  </li>
            <li> Adhering to the Coding Standard is expected, but expectations are less strict than for
  Projects.</li>
     </ol></li>
     </ul>
    <p>
    Online students (Section 730) hand in lab exercises using Mimir and are due at 11:59 PM on the due date (usually
  Fridays).
    </p><p>
   <b>Important:</b> Students who get a zero on more than two (2) laboratory exercises 
    will have their course grade <i> reduced </i> by <i> 0.5 for each laboratory exercise 
    missed</i> beyond two. For example, if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but 
    zeros four (4) laboratory exercises, that student's grade will be 
    reduced by 2*0.5 to a 2.0 course grade. 
  </p>

  <h2> Chapter Exercises </h2>
  <p>
    Students will be assigned Chapter Exercises (on Mimir). 
    Collaboration is encouraged.  
  <br><br>
    Chapter Exercises constitute 10% of the course points.
    Chapter Exercises are recorded as Correct/NotCorrect. There is no limit to the number of tries to
  getting a chapter exercise correct.  For each question your solutions will be submitted if you click on
  either "Submit Assignment" or "Save Work". Final grades are not recorded until instructors manually hit the "grade" button.
  </p>
  <h2> Computer Projects </h2>
  <p>
    A series of computer projects will be assigned, and will constitute 45% of the total course points.
    The projects will include the design and implementation of solutions using Python.
    Projects are submitted through Mimir.
    Late projects are not accepted (see exception above).
    If you are unable to complete a project by the due date because of illness or personal emergency,
    contact your instructor.  If appropriate, an extension will be granted.
  </p>
  <p>
  Programming projects are to be done individually -- unlike labs and chapter exercises that are done collaboratively.  
  If a programming project is done
  in collaboration with another student, you will both be assigned a zero with an Academic Dishonesty report filed with the
  University : see note about Academic
  Integrity below.
  </p>
  <p>
  For submission and auto-testing of projects we use Mimir, a commercial product. There is normally a $25 charge,
  but don't pay it because the Engineering Dean has agreed to pay it -- details are being worked out at the start
  of the semester.
  </p>
  <h2> Academic Integrity </h2>
  <p>
  The Department of Computer Science and Engineering expects all students to adhere to MSU's General Student Regulation
  1.00, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, which states:
  <p>
  The principles of truth and honesty are fundamental to the educational process and the academic integrity of the
  University; therefore, no student shall:
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
  <p class="tab">
  1.01  claim or submit the academic work of another as one's own.
  </p>
  <p class="tab">
  1.02  procure, provide, accept or use any materials containing questions or answers to any examination or
  assignment without proper authorization.
  </p>
  <p class="tab">
  1.03  complete or attempt to complete any assignment or examination for another individual without proper
  authorization.
  </p>
  <p class="tab">
  1.04  allow any examination or assignment to be completed for oneself, in part or in total, by another without
  proper authorization.
  </p>
  <p class="tab">
  1.05  alter, tamper with, appropriate, destroy or otherwise interfere with the research, resources, or other
  academic work of another person.
  </p>
  <p class="tab">
  1.06  fabricate or falsify data or results
  </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
  In particular, examinations and computer projects are individual assignments:  anything which you submit for
  grading must be your own work.
  <p>
  For the computer projects, you are encouraged to discuss the specifications and problem-solving strategies with
  your instructor, your Teaching Assistant, and other students from the class.  However, once you begin implementing
  your solution in Python, you must work individually.
  Under no circumstances should you allow another student to view or copy your solution.  
  Note that each project solution is
  electronically compared to all other solutions to identify similar solutions.  
  <p>
  Students who submit similar solutions will receive a penalty grade, such as a score of zero for that assignment or a grade of
  zero in the course. 
  In all cases of penalty grades an Academic Dishonesty report is filed with the University.
  <p>
  If you show your code to another student, you are almost guaranteed a zero because most novice
  programmers will not be able to think of another way to do it and end up copying your code or
  sharing it with someone else who copies it.
  <p>
  Finally, consider the <a href="https://honorcode.msu.edu/">Spartan Honor Code</a>: As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the
  highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that
  honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University,
  continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.
  <p>
  <h2> Notes </h2>
  <p>
    Any extenuating circumstances that impact on your participation in the
    course should be discussed with your lecture instructor as soon as those
    circumstances are known (such as absences due to illness, religious
    observances, or other required school activities).
  <br><br>
    All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer system
    provided for this course.  Account usage guidelines published by the
    Department of Computer Science and Engineering are posted under:
