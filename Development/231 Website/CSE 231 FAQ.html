</ul>

<li><H3> Course Mechanics </H3>
<ul>

<li><H4>Where do I find Mimir?</H4>
There is a link to Mimir on D2L for the course.

<li><H4> I missed my weekly lab session.  What do I do? </H4>
If you miss a scheduled lab session due to illness or personal emergency,
please contact your TA.  If appropriate, your TA will permit you to make up
the missed lab exercise within one week of the original due date.

<li><H4> I missed the due date for a computer project.  What do I do? </H4>
Automatically one-day late is a 50% penalty; after that, no credit.
If you are unable to complete a computer project by the specified due date
due to illness or personal emergency, please contact your lecture instructor.
If appropriate, the assignment due date will be extended.

<li><H4> I have a question about the grading of my project.  Who do I contact? </H4>
Please contact your TA.  
If you are not able to resolve things with your TA, contact an instructor.

<li><H4> I missed an examination.  What do I do? </H4>
Please contact your instructor. 

<li><H4> I have a question about the grading of my exam.  Who do I contact? </H4>
Please contact your instructor. 

<li><H4> I need extra help. </H4>
Help comes in many forms for this course:
<ul>
<li> TAs staff a help room in the same room as the CSE 231 lab (3320 Engineering). The schedule is found under the
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/General/ta.consulting.hours"><em>Consulting Hours link</em></a> on the course web
page.</li>
<li> TAs monitor 
<a href="https://piazza.com">Piazza.com</a> where you can post questions. <em>Piazza provides the fastest response of
all options.</em></li>
<li> Contact your TA directly. Their email address is posted at the
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/General/ta.lab.hours"><em>Lab Sessions link</em></a> on the course web
page</li>
<li> Contact your instructor -- see the syllabus.</li>
<li> Some students want a <b>tutor</b>.  
The department does not have the resources to screen and train tutors.  Some students have had luck finding a tutor online through
Craigslist, the department Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cse.msu.edu/">page</a> and <a
href="https://www.universitytutor.com/">universitytutor.com</a>.  We encourage care when working with a
private tutor, both for personal safety, e.g. only meet in public places such as a library, and a tutor without proper training may do more work for you as opposed to helping you.
<!--
The Diversity Programs Office 
(<a href="http://www.egr.msu.edu/dpo/welcome-diversity-programs-office-dpo-website">link</a>) in the Engineering Building can help you
find a tutor (this is open to <em>all</em> students taking Engineering courses such as CSE 231).</li>

<li><H3>Spyder</H3>
<ul>
<li><H4> My shell and variable explorer windows have disappeared.
How do I get them back?  </H4>
Use Consoles -> open an IPython Console for the kernel
<br>
Use View -> Panes to open any window you want, including the
variable explorer
</li>
<li><H4>Re-install did not solve my problems</H4>
If re-install did not fix your problems, you likely need to do a more complete un-install of the previous version.

<li><H3>Can I use a different IDE than Spyder</H3>
<ul>
<li><H4>You can use any IDE, but we only support Anaconda+Spyder, i.e. you are on your own.</H4>
The important thing is for the IDE to support graphics, e.g. pylab or matplotlib.  Here is testing code
that works on Spyder.
<code>
<br>
import pylab<br>
L = [1,2,3,4,5,6]<br>
pylab.plot(L)
</code>
</li>
<li><H4>PyCharm</H4>
Here is a note from a student who successfully installed PyCharm.  My suggestion was to install Anaconda
(Python) and then have PyCharm point to that.  Here is what he said: "It doesn't seem terribly hard to
install. I installed Anaconda, then PyCharm (didn't have it on this laptop), and created a new project
and chose the "Conda interpreter" in the dropdown. Then I installed matplotlib from the project
settings, imported it using a named import, and then added pylab.interactive(True) since supposedly that
allows it to work inline on PyCharm, and was able to run it from the python console without issue."
He tested plotting with the following code:
<code>
import matplotlib.pylab as pylab<br>
pylab.interactive(True)<br>
L = [1,2,3,4,5,6]<br>
pylab.plot(L)
</code>
